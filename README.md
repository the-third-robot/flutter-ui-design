# sketch_app

This flutter project contain a drawing board using which user can draw anything with free hands. Different colors
can be used and the thickness can be adjusted with subsequent functionalities.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

This is just a UI design as an assignment of recruiting organization, 
the only functional thing in the application is the drawing board which was already created by me and the drawing 
board can be found on click of Add(+) icon of bottom navigation bar added inside the app.
